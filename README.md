MCScript
========

Minecraft server management script.

`mc.sh` is a Minecraft server script.
`bn.sh` is a BungeeCord server script.

They are written in bash, and contains a handful of functions.

You can put them whereever you want, and configure it with the variables in the top of the script. I generally have one script per server.

It is not complete at the moment, so I wouldn't use it in a production environment without testing.
