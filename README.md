MCScript
========

MCScript is a Minecraft server management script, written in bash.

You can download the script, then simply run `./glowstone.sh start` to create a server directory, download the latest Glowstone build, and run the server inside a tmux session.

The configuration for what directories to use is done with variables at the top of the script. If you want to run multiple servers, you can create copies of glowstone.sh for each server.
