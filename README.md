MinecraftServerScripts
======================

Newlanders's Minecraft Server Scripts

General Idea
============
MinecraftServerScripts are some scripts that make server administration a bit easier for us who are on linux systems.

They are written in bash, I wrote them for my own minecraft server.

Then I decided that they might be useful, so I put them here.

Just copy the file 'mc.sh' to where you want, add `alias mc='/home/whatever/wherever/mc.sh'` to your .bashrc and start using it.
Just using the command `mc` will result in a help message.
