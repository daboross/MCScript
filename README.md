MCScript
========

Minecraft server management script.

`mc.sh` is a script that makes server administration a bit easier on linux systems.

It is written in bash, and contains a handful of functions.

You can put it whereever you want, and configure it with the variables in the top of the script. I generally have one script per server.

It is not complete at the moment, so I wouldn't use it in a production environment without testing.
